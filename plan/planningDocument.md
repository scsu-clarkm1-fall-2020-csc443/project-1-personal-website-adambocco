# Site Plan - dms.com

## Overview

*dms.com* is a website for the business 'Diversified Manufacturing and Services' (DMS). The goal of this site is to showcase the company, detail the company's products and services, and provide methods of contacting the business. The site will be a professional platform to increase the amount of requests to the business for their specific products and services.

This site will target prospective clients that are looking for an electronics manufacturer. Today it is expected that a legitimate business have a professional-looking website to inform the client and bridge their communication. Therefore, it is necessary that DMS provide an online presence to provide information about the business and facilitate client communication.

The site will be primarily static and built from scratch, custom to the professional environment DMS wishes to project. The content will span several pages and cover a general description of the company, specific manufacturing and design services, and methods of contacting and requesting quotes. The website will focus on responsive design and have a fluid, professional look on all platforms. The site will complement the logo and images for the company which will consist of pc boards and industrial equipment by providing cool green tones and light and dark pastel-like brown colors. Some such colors are #effcef, #ccedd2, #94d3ac, #655c56, and #eeecda

## Similar Sites

### eei-hvac.com

* Environmental Engineering Inc. has an excellent responsive design that reflects the goals of this site in the way that content is offset on larger sreens and stacked on smaller screens. The navbar is simple and provides a logo which *dms.com* will have. It also has a map pinning their location on the home page.

<a href="https://www.eei-hvac.com/"><img style="vertical-align:top;" src="img/eei.png" width=200></a>

### edmva.com

* EDMVA has an excellent landing page with modern-styled images describing their services and a striking video background near the contact section. The home page for *dms.com* will be similar to this, but on smaller devices, the page will be less cluttered. EDMVA does not scale the images describing their services on smaller screens, so it makes for a tedious section to scroll through, although the same section looks great on larger screens. 

<a href="https://www.edmva.com"><img style="vertical-align:top;" src="img/edmva.png" width=200></a>

### osda.com

* OSDA's website is also responsive but has a simple, uncluttered layout that more aggresively directs the user towards submitting an order. The site also looks great at all screen sizes, even extra large in which the red background logo has room to fill the margins. *dms.com* will have similar responsive navigation design in which on larger screens, there will be a top-fixed header, and on smaller screens a navigation menu will be toggled.
