                In 1989, Diversified Engineering was founded, offered a broad range of contract engineering and design services. Customers who were satisfied with their services requested that they also handle their manufacturing. In 2006, Diversified Manufacturing and Services, llc became a separate business entity with a focus on the assembly and support of electronic circuit boards.

                    Whether you’re going to market with a new product, looking for competitive quotes or keeping your present contract manufacturer “honest”, we simply ask for an opportunity to quote. If we feel we could provide the services you require, then we’ll provide a competitive quote. In rare instances, a job may require specialized equipment we don’t currently possess. We’ll either invest in an upgrade (if it makes sense) or appreciate the opportunity but will decline to quote.

                    As a customer, your end goal is on time delivery of working products at an acceptable price from a reliable supplier that will partner up and seamlessly work alongside your company. You should expect nothing less.
                    Customers come and go and products get phased out over time in this business. Diversified Manufacturing has never lost a customer due to quality, performance or lead time issues. We support the products we manufacture. As a company, we’re always looking to continuously improve.
                    Product quality and on time delivery is my direct responsibility.
